# Habit-14 Memory Harness Summary

Run date: 2026-05-15

Artifacts:

- Script: `scripts/compare_habit_memory.py`
- Plugged-in result: `docs/habit-memory-plugged.json`

## Purpose

This harness tests one small HPP mechanism:

> Can repeated safe exposure create a protected pathway that resists later noise better than an unprotected state?

This is a toy mechanism harness, not a learned intelligence benchmark.

The biological analogy is habit formation and muscle memory. A human does not create a reliable habit from one exposure. Repetition gradually turns a difficult action into a more stable pathway that can still execute under noise, fatigue, distraction, or stress.

## Method

The harness creates a clean signal, exposes a simple memory prototype to repeated noisy versions of that signal, then tests recall under heavier noise.

Conditions tested:

- 1 exposure
- 7 exposures
- 14 exposures
- 21 exposures

The protection gate remains off before the Habit-14 threshold. Once 14 exposures are reached, recall blends the noisy input with the stored prototype.

## Result

Plugged-in run on CUDA:

| Exposures | Locked | Protection | Mean protected MSE | Mean improvement |
|---:|:---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | no | 0.000 | 0.89930525 | 1.00000000 |
| 7 | no | 0.000 | 0.89944071 | 1.00000000 |
| 14 | yes | 0.720 | 0.07076542 | 12.73755424 |
| 21 | yes | 0.895 | 0.01011357 | 89.63142983 |

## Interpretation

The threshold behavior worked:

- Before 14 exposures, the memory does not intervene.
- At 14 exposures, the protected pathway reduces noisy recall error by about 12.74x.
- At 21 exposures, the protected pathway reduces noisy recall error by about 89.63x.

The result is intentionally narrow: a repeated pattern becomes easier to recover from noise once the habit threshold is reached. It does not claim general intelligence or language quality.

## Design Lesson

Habit-14 should not mean "believe a pattern after one exposure."

V5 should treat stabilization as:

- thresholded
- inspectable
- protected from noise
- reversible or adjustable after lock
- checked for rigidity when a context changes

This supports a more mature HPP rule:

> Repetition should create protected pathways, and mature systems need controlled plasticity after stabilization.

Human-facing translation:

> Habit-14 is the point where repeated practice begins acting less like a fresh decision and more like muscle memory.

## Changed-Context Follow-Up

Artifact:

- `docs/changed-context-habit-memory-summary.md`

The next harness tested whether a protected pathway can preserve a stable core without becoming brittle when context changes.

At 21 exposures on the plugged RTX 4050 run:

- shifted-context adaptive recall improved over noisy baseline by 47.17974545x
- shifted-context adaptive recall improved over a rigid full-pattern lock by 17.01315969x

Meaning:

Habit-14 should protect the core pathway, not freeze every surrounding condition. This supports a more mature HPP rule: stabilized memory needs context-aware plasticity, otherwise it can become a rigid habit instead of an adaptive one.
